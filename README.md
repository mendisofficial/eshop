### Getting Started
1. **Install Git:** If Git is not installed on your computer, download and install it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
2. **Clone the Repository:**
    - Click the "Code" button, then copy the repository URL.
    - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
    - Run the command: `git clone <repository_url>` (replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL you copied).
3. **Install Composer:** Composer is a dependency management tool for PHP. Download and install it from [getcomposer.org/download](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

4. **Run Composer:**
    - In your terminal, run the command: `composer install` in the project directory.
    - Composer will read the `composer.json` file and install the required dependencies into a directory called `vendor`.

5. **Configure Environment Variables:** Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the project's root directory. Open the `.env` file and fill in the necessary values according to your environment.
